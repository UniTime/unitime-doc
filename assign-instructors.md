## Screen Description

In Assign Instructors, you can enter instructor names for each of the classes and set some properties of this assignment. When you assign an instructor to a departmental class, the preferences of the instructor are automatically inherited on the class if the instructor is marked as lead and has instructor preferences (even if "Inherit instructor preferences on a class" is set to "ask" or "never" in [Manager Settings](manager-settings)). You can assign more than one instructor to a class. You can also go through the instructional offerings (configurations) one by one using Next and/or Previous buttons.

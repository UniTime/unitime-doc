## Screen Description

Instructor Roles page can be used to assign a role (that has the Instructor toggle checked, see [Roles](roles) page) to an instructor or other department personel. That is to anyone from the [Instructors](instructors) page for a particular department. This feature may be handy if a schedule manager or event manager is allowed to dedicate some (usually lesser) roles to people within his/her department. For instance, an event manager can give other people from the department to request and/or approve event in the departmental event rooms. Or, a schedule manager can dedicate some part of the data entry to his/her assistants. To enable this functionality, appropriate roles need to be created on the [Roles](roles) page with the appropriate permissions provided on the [Permissions](permissions) page first.

## Details

Each instructor of a department can be given a role. If a new person is looked up, an appropriate instructor is also created on the [Instructors](instructors) page.

Users of department dependent roles (e.g., an event manager or a schedule manager) can see all instructors of their department(s).

**Note:** Only roles that have the **Instructor** toggle checked on the [Roles](roles) page can be used.

## Screen Description

The Class Assignments screen is the only place where you can see classes from other departments. For example, you can find times and rooms of large lecture room classes for Physics, computing labs for English, or departmental classes of Visual and Performing Arts. Filtered results of your search are sorted by the subject area and if you export the results into a PDF, each subject area will begin on a new page in the resulting document.

### Filter

* **Manager**

* **Instructional Type**
	* Select whether you want to see all types of classes or only e.g. Lectures

* **Assigned Time**
	* Indicate whether you want to see only classes taught at a specific time and/or on specific days (if nothing is entered for Assigned Time, all times/days are considered - you do not need to check all days)

* **Assigned Room**
	* Filter by room assigned to a class during timetabling

* **Sort By**
	* Select how you want to sort the resulting list of classes

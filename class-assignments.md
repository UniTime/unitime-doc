## Screen Description

The Class Assignments screen is the only place where you can see classes from other departments. For example, you can find the times and rooms of large lecture room classes for Physics, computing labs for English, or departmental classes in the Visual and Performing Arts. The filtered results of your search are sorted by subject area. If you export the results into a PDF, each subject area will begin on a new page in the resulting document.

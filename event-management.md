Most colleges and universities make use of their facilities for more than scheduled classes. Guest speakers, club meetings, study sessions, and other activities need to be scheduled to a variety of campus spaces. UniTime automatically creates events for all class meetings and examinations in the events calendar for the academic session. Additional events can be added to rooms used by classes, or any other campus facility in the system, using the web-based Events interface. This interface can be made available to all staff and students for requesting events and/or searching for available times and locations. Different event managers can be assigned to control the assignment of different groups of spaces. Status notices are automatically sent to event organizers as well as being readily available on a My Events page.

### Table

The list of reservations resulting from the search has the following columns

* **Reservation Type**
	* Individual, Student Group, Curriculum, or Course

* **Owner**
	* The particular student, student group, curriculum or course for which the reservation has been made
	* For student groups, there is a number in parenthesis next to the group name - it indicates how many students this reservation affects; that is, how many students there are in the student group

* **Restrictions**
	* Restrictions within the instructional offering regarding which part(s) of the instructional offering the reservation is set on
	* The number in parenthesis indicates what capacity the sections in the restrictions have (it is then possible to compare them to the number in the Reserved Space column)

* **Reserved Space**
	* Number of reserved spaces
	* âˆž if the whole part of an instructional offering is reserved

	* Number of students from the last-like semester that match the reservation

* **Projection by Rule**
	* Number of projected students that match the reservation

* **Current Enrollment**

* **Stat Date**

	*  If there is no start date, the reservation is active until it expires

* **Expiration Date**
	* Date upon which the reservation expires, i.e., the reserved spaces are made available for other students
	* If there is no expiration date displayed, the reservation does not expire

If the reservation is in grey letters, it is not editable (either you do not have the right to edit it or, during student scheduling, you need to go through the [Instructional Offering Detail](instructional-offering-detail) screen to first lock the instructional offering to be able to make changes and then make changes from the [Instructional Offering Detail](instructional-offering-detail) screen, the section Reservations).

Click on any column header and then on the "Sort by..." menu item that pops up to sort by that column.

Click on any line with a reservation (if it is in black letters) to go to its [Edit Reservation](edit-reservation) screen to make changes.

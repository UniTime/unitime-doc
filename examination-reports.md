## Screen Description

In the Examination Reports screen, the user can view and export a report created from examination data either for a selected subject area or for all subject areas at once.

![Examination Reports](images/examination-reports-1.png){:class='screenshot'}

The user can click on any examination to get to its [Examination Detail](examination-detail) screen (and from there for example to the [Examination Assignment](examination-assignment) screen to make changes if needed).

There is another screen, [Examination PDF Reports](examination-pdf-reports), which provides interface for sending PDF reports to any users of the application (and any other email addresses too), so the examination timetabling manager does not need to generate and send reports via emails "manually" in this Examination Reports screen.

## Filter

	* Show classes/courses instead of examinations

		* There are exceptions, such as in the Room Assignment Report, the filter is applied to the Room column; or, in reports for instructors/students, an ID or student/instructor name may be entered
	* Hint: use comma for conjunctions, semicolon for disjunctions, e.g., 'a,b;c' means '(a and b) or c'

* **Subject Areas**
	* A drop down list of subject areas with an option to select all of them
	* If you need to select a few subject areas, you can use the filter for that - for example, to select PTGS and SPAN, type "ptgs; span" in the filter (without the quotation marks)

**Note:** By changing the gradable subpart, the Banner form SSASECT will be updated to reflect the gradable subpart, populate the approved course credit hours/billing hours and check the appropriate Banner box labeled gradable. The non-gradable subpart will have zero credit/billing hours and will be flagged as non-gradable.

### Course Projections

* **Group**
	* The user can define groups of courses that have students in common (such as "1st semester mandatory courses", etc.) or that do not have students in common (such as optional courses for 2nd semester students, out of which each student selects only one course)

		2. Click on the column header ("Group")
		3. In the menu that opens, click on "New Group"
		4. In the small screen that opens, enter the **Name** (an alphabet letter is suggested as default) and select the **Type**
			* "No conflict (different students)" - for courses that can overlap in time because they do not have students in common
			* "Conflict (same students)" - for courses that have students in common and therefore should not overlap in time
		5. Click on the **Assign** button to assign the group to the courses
	* To add a course to an existing group

		1. Click on the course (possibly in the Group column, not on the name of another group) - the course will become highlighted in blue

			2. Percentage of the total requested enrollment for the given classification (that is, percentage of the number from the Requested Enrollment line for the given classification in the Curriculum Classification section of this screen) - in this case, the "%" sign has to be a part of the entered percentage (example: "25%")
	* An academic classification is displayed in the table only if there is a requested enrollment number in the appropriate column in the Curriculum Classification section of this screen
	* After clicking on a header of a column related to an academic classification, a menu appears; the first options apply to the whole table and are described above (in the Course header section); the remaining options, applying to a particular column, are as follows

	* The table compares the course on which the mouse is placed with the other courses that have been previously selected (and are highlighted in blue)

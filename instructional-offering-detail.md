There can be one or more configurations per instructional offering. Each of them should be an approved configuration. This is not automatically checked against the course catalog at the time of entry.

For each configuration, the following operations are available:

The configuration part of this screen also includes a legend to explain the colors associated with preferences.

## Teaching Requests

Teaching requests are used in the [Instructor Scheduling](instructor-scheduling). Instructors that are to be assigned automatically are not requested directly on classes, but there are teaching requests. Each teaching request may include multiple classes of the same course and provide some additional constraints.

![Instructional Offering Detail](images/instructional-offering-detail-4.png){:class='screenshot'}

Use the [Setup Teaching Requests](setup-teaching-requests) button to set up teaching requests. The created teaching requests are visible in the Teaching Requests section of the Instructor Offering Detail page. They can be edited by clicking the [Setup Teaching Requests](setup-teaching-requests) button again.

Once the solver has run, the table also shows the current instructor assignments, together with their details (instructor external id, name, assigned / maximal teaching load, attributes, time, course, and distribution preferences). The [Teaching Request Detail](teaching-request-detail) dialog is displayed when a teaching request is clicked, allowing you to view more details and make assignment changes with or without the solver loaded in memory (see the Solver chapter below for more information).

Each teaching request contains:

* Classes that are associated with the teaching requests (classes that the instructor is not to be assigned to are in italics)

* Teaching load

* Number of instructors needed

* Attribute and instructor preferences and requirements

* Same course / common preference

* Assigned instructors and their current/maximal teaching load, time preferences and availability, course and distribution preferences

    * Expected number of students to take the examination

* **Max Rooms**
    * The maximum number of rooms into which an examination can be split (for example, an examination for a class of 400 students can be split into two or three rooms if they need to use the Exam seating type and do not have a room with exam seating capacity of 400 seats)

* **Instructor**
    * Instructors associated with the examination

* **Assigned Period**

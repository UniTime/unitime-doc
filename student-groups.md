Student groups are useful in many ways in UniTime. They allow to put any list of students into a group, which can be used for student scheduling, e.g., by creating a [Group Reservation](reservations) or to filter by the group in the [Online Student Scheduling Dashboards](online-student-scheduling-dashboard). The groups can also be used to prioritize certain students in the student scheduling solver.

## Properties

Each student group contains the following properties:

* **External Id**
	* External ID of the student group
	* External IDs are only editable via the [XML import](https://www.unitime.org/uct_interfaces.php)
	* Student groups with an external ID cannot be deleted. The presence of the External ID indicates that the student group has been imported from an external system.

* **Code**
	* Code or abbreviation of the student group name

* **Name**
	* Name of the student group

* **Type**
	* An optional type of the group (the various types can be edited on the [Student Group Types](student-group-types) screen)

* **Expected Size**
	* Expected number of students in the group
	* An optional field

* **Students**
	* Number of students in the student group
	* Add/Edit: list of individual students in the group
	* Editable only for groups that have been added through the [Add Student Group](add-student-group) screen in UniTime (not editable for the student groups with External Ids)

## Operations

The table can be filtered by the group type. Click **Search** to populate the page based on the selected type.

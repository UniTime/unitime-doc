## Details

* **Distribution Type**
	* Type of the distribution preference (such as Back-To-Back)
	* When you select the type, its description appears right under the drop down list
	* You can see a complete list of types in [Types of Distribution Preferences](types-of-distribution-preferences)

* **Structure**
	* Structure of the preference (such as Groups of Two)
	* When you select the structure, its description appears right under the drop down list
	* You can see a complete list of possible structures in [Structure of Distribution Preferences](structure-of-distribution-preferences)

* **Preference**
	* Preference level for this distribution preference
	* Certain types of preferences have smaller scale than others (e.g., "Can Share Room" can only have Preference "Required" or "Neutral")

* **Classes in Distribution**
	* Click on the **Add Class** (Alt+C) button to add a line with drop down lists (as many times as you need)
		* The drop down lists are populated based on the previous column; the columns are:
			* Subject Area
			* CourseÂ 
			* Scheduling Subpart
			* Class Number (or All, if the preference should be applied to the whole scheduling subpart)
	* The up and down arrows can be used to change the order of classes if order is important (for example, when the Distribution Type "Precedence" is used) You can delete any of the lines with classes by clicking on the **Delete** button at the end of the line

## Operations

* **Save** (Alt+S)
	* Save this new distribution preference and go back to [Distribution Preferences](distribution-preferences)

* **Back** (Alt+B)
	* Go back to [Distribution Preferences](distribution-preferences) without saving this new preference

## Details

* **Distribution Type**
	* Type of the distribution preference (such as Back-To-Back)
	* When you select the type, its description appears right under the drop down list
	* You can see a complete list of types in [Types of Distribution Preferences](types-of-distribution-preferences)

* **Structure**
	* Structure of the preference (such as Groups of Two)

	* You can see a complete list of possible structures in [Structure of Distribution Preferences](structure-of-distribution-preferences)

* **Preference**
	* Preference level for this distribution preference
	* Certain types of preferences have smaller scale than others (e.g., "Can Share Room" can only have Preference "Required" or "Neutral")

* **Classes in Distribution**
	* Click on the **Add Class** (Alt+C) button to add a line with drop down lists (as many times as you need)
		* The drop-down lists are populated based on the previous column; the columns are:
			* Subject Area
			* Course 
			* Scheduling Subpart
			* Class Number (or All, if the preference should be applied to the whole scheduling subpart)
* The up ![Up](images/icon-up.png) and down ![Down](images/icon-down.png) arrows can be used to change the order of classes if order is important (for example, when the Distribution Type "Precedence" is used)
* You can delete any of the lines with classes by clicking on the ![Delete](images/icon-delete.png) icon at the end of the line

## Operations

* **Save** (Alt+S)
	* Save this new distribution preference and go back to [Distribution Preferences](distribution-preferences)

* **Back** (Alt+B)
	* Go back to [Distribution Preferences](distribution-preferences) without saving this new preference

## Notes

### Sample use of this screen

Situation: The user wants to switch rooms for two examinations that are held at the same time. At the beginning, Exam 1 has Room A at a certain time, and Exam 2 has Room B at the same time. The user wants to end up with Exam 1 in Room B and Exam 2 in Room A, time unchanged.

Solution:

1. Get to this Examination Assignment screen for Exam 1 from, e.g., the list of Examinations.
2. In Available Periods, click on the time period highlighted with a blue background - that is the currently assigned time period.
3. In the Available Rooms section (that showed up after clicking on the time period), check the "Allow conflicts" checkbox and click Apply. Room B should appear in red letters.
4. Click on Room B in the Available Rooms
5. In the New Assignment(s) section, click on Exam 2 (the line with Exam 2 was added to New Assignment(s) because the room for Exam 2 was unassigned)
6. In Available Periods, click on the time period that also became unassigned (the time that you want to keep)
7. In Available Rooms, click on Room A; now the New Assignment(s) section should show a change that results in Exam 1 having Room B and Exam 2 having Room A.
8. Click on the Assign button under the New Assignment(s) section
9. Click OK in the pop-up window (yes, you want to save changes)

The switch has been made!

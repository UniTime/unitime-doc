**Note:** The class timetable is available for students and instructors only if the academic session is in a status that includes no-role class schedule (the status type's properties can be changed in the [Edit Status Type](edit-status-type) screen).

**Note:** Filter settings may be passed on the URL, e.g., the following URL will select all classes of ALG subject area for Fall 2010 on woebegon campus:

## Apereo Foundation Contributor License Agreements

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with all contributions from any person or entity, The Apereo Foundation must have a Contributor License Agreement on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of UniTime and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

There are two versions of the Agreement:
* [Apereo Foundation Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apereo.org/licensing/agreements/icla) that allows an individual to submit Contributions to UniTime, and to grant copyright and patent licenses thereto.
* [Apereo Foundation Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apereo.org/licensing/agreements/ccla) that allows an entity (the "Corporation") to submit Contributions to UniTime, to authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees to UniTime, and to grant copyright and patent licenses thereto.

If you wish to contribute to UniTime and you have not already done so, please complete and sign, then scan and email a PDF file of the Agreement to licensing@apereo.org.

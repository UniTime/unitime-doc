Hint: To compare two saved solutions, load one solution into the solver (using [Timetables](timetables) page) and then select the second one (also using [Timetables](timetables) page).

* **Compare with**
	* Select with which timetable you want the current timetable to be compared
	* Options:
		* Best Solution - best solution found so far (either generated by the solver or saved by the user to the best timetable found so far in the [Solver](solver) screen)
		* Initial Solution - timetable initially loaded into the solver (it needn't be the same as the selected solution, since some classes might have been assigned/unassigned due to a change in input data)
		* Selected Solution - timetable selected in the [Saved Timetables](saved-timetables) screen
		* Committed Solution - committed timetable

* **Simplified mode**
	* In the simplified mode, only the number of additional student conflicts is displayed for each change
	* When unchecked, more criteria are listed for each change

## Screen Description

The Online Student Scheduling Dashboard screen provides a tool for displaying a given set of course requests/student enrollments or students. The page also displays information from the sectioning log (either for a particular student or by a given filter). The page is available for administrators, scheduling deputies (can approve consent), student advisors (can change student enrollment), and course coordinators (can approve consent of instructor). Course coordinators can only see courses that are assigned to them. The page has extensive filtering capabilities (by the student, group, curriculum, course, subject, consent, ...). It is possible to email students and/or change their scheduling status (admin only).

See [Student Scheduling Dashboard Manual](manuals/scheduling-dashboard) for additional documentation about the dashboard.

## Filter

The filter at the top of the Online Student Scheduling Dashboard page controls the search criteria used to display data on the page. When the user accesses the Online Student Scheduling Dashboard page for the first time the filter will be blank. Once the user has entered search criteria in the filter and performed a search the page will remember the last search performed by the user and automatically populate the filter with that search criteria the next time the user accesses the page.  See [Scheduling Dashboard Filter](scheduling-dashboard-filter) for more details.

**Note:** In addition to any search criteria entered into the Filter, the data displayed in the Scheduling Dashboard is also filtered by the access to the data granted by a user’s role.

## Details

The page shows up to three tabs - **Enrollments** with detailed information about courses and classes, **Students** with enrollment information ordered by students, and **Change Log** with a list of changes in enrollments. See the description for each of them below.

## Enrollments

![Online Student Scheduling Dashboard](images/online-student-scheduling-dashboard-1.png){:class='screenshot'}

* A column with clickable plus signs that enable unfolding of a course into lines with individual classes

* **Subject / Type**
	* Subject area on the line with a course
	* Instructional Type on the line with a class

* **Course / External Id**
	* Course number on the line with a course
	* External Id or section number on the line with a class

* **Title / Time**

* **Consent / Room**
	* Type of required consent for a course (if empty, no consent is required)
	* Room where a class is taught

* **Available**
	* Total number of available seats / total number of seats
	* The column has two numbers separated by a slash (/).  The first number is the total number of unused space in the course or class.  The second number is the size limit for the course or class.  For example: 5 / 25 would mean there are 5 available spaces in a class that holds 25 students.

* **Projection**
	* Total number of projected students for the course or class

* **Snapshot Limit**
	* The course / class snapshot limit (a limit taken at a certain time)

* **Enrollment**
	* Number of students enrolled into the course or class (filtered by filtering criteria)
	* When the search criteria used in the Filter does not restrict the student population then a single number which is the total number of students enrolled in the course or class is displayed.  For example, if there 20 students enrolled in a class then the number 20 would be displayed.  When the search criteria used in the Filter restricts the student population for the data displayed in this column, there will be two numbers separated by a slash (/).  For example, if 3 of the students in the population retrieved by the search criteria in the Filter are enrolled in the class and in total there are 20 students enrolled in the class, then the number displayed would be 3 / 20.

* **Not-Enrolled**
	* Number of students who have requested the course or class but are not enrolled in it (filtered by filtering criteria)
	* When the search criteria used in the Filter does not restrict the student population, then a single number equal to the total number of students who have the course listed in their course request but are not enrolled in the course, is displayed.  For example, if there 2 students who requested a course but did not receive it, then the number 2 would be displayed.  When the search criteria used in the Filter does restrict the student population for the data displayed in this column, there will be two numbers separated by a slash(/).  For example, if 1 of the students in the population retrieved by the search criteria in the Filter requested the course but did not receive it and in total there are 2 students who requested the course but did not receive it, then the number displayed would be 1 / 2.

* **Alternative**
	* Number of students who have requested the course (as an alternative) or class but are not enrolled in it (filtered by filtering criteria)
	* When the search criteria used in the Filter does not restrict the student population then a single number which is the total number of students who have the course listed in their course request as an alternative is displayed.  For example, if there 5 students who requested a course as an alternative then the number 5 would be displayed.  When the search criteria used in the Filter does restrict the student population for the data displayed, this column will have two numbers separated by a slash(/).  For example, if 2 of the students in the population retrieved by the search criteria in the Filter requested the course as an alternative and in total there are 5 students who requested the course as an alternative, then the number displayed would be 2 / 5.

* **Reservation**
	* Number of students enrolled into the course or class via a reservation (filtered by filtering criteria)
	* When the search criteria used in the Filter does not restrict the student population, a single number equal to the total number of students who have been placed into the course or class as the result of a reservation is displayed.  For example, if there were 3 students who were placed into a course as a result of a reservation then the number 3 would be displayed.  When the search criteria used in the Filter does restrict the student population for the data displayed the in this column will be two numbers separated by a slash(/).  For example, if 1 of the students in the population retrieved by the search criteria in the Filter was placed into a course as a result of a reservation and in total there are 3 students who were placed into a course as a result of a reservation, then the number displayed would be 1 / 3.

* **Need Consent**
	* Number of students who need consent of instructor to be able to take the course (filtered by filtering criteria)
	* When the search criteria used in the Filter does not restrict the student population then a single number which is the total number of students who required some form of consent to enroll in the course or class is displayed.  For example, if there were 4 students who required some form of consent to enroll in a course then the number 4 would be displayed.  When the search criteria used in the Filter does restrict the student population for the data displayed the in this column will be two numbers separated by a slash(/).  For example, if 2 of the students in the population retrieved by the search criteria in the Filter required some form of consent to enroll in a course and in total there are 4 students who required some form of consent to enroll in a course, then the number displayed would be 2 / 4.

* **Need Override**
	* This column is only populated if UniTime is integrated with a system that will inform UniTime of the need for overrides.  This label applies to both the course and class level data. When the search criteria used in the Filter does not restrict the student population then a single number which is the total number of students who require an override to enroll in the course or class is displayed.  For example, if there were 6 students who require an override to enroll in a course then the number 6 would be displayed.  When the search criteria used in the Filter does restrict the student population for the data displayed the in this column will be two numbers separated by a slash(/).  For example, if 2 of the students in the population retrieved by the search criteria in the Filter require an override to enroll in a course and in total there are 6 students who require an override to enroll in a course, then the number displayed would be 2 / 6.
